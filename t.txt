1)  Algorithm is steps to do anything 
==> here for example the code we write to solve data structure problem is known as Algorithm


2) Algorithm Complexity
==> it means that what way we are choosing or which step we are taking like if i want to go to my friends house u am i taking the shortcut aur going with my bike according to distenace or the weight i am carrying  
==> this steps is done to make our code cost effective and space efficient 


==> It is of two type: 
        a)Time Complexity ==> It is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the execution or the number of lines of code used to finish the execution
                          ==> It directly depends on input example: for sorting we use 2 loops number of elements in a array is input, so for 6 elements loops will run 6*6 =36 (2 loops) if number for input increase then the number of running the loop will also increase hence Time complexity will also increases

        b)space Complexity ==> space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem
                           ==> Auxiliary space + input size

3) Big O notation ==> It is just a sign use to denote complexity(both)

4) Asymptotic analysis and notation

a)Asymptotic analysis ==> it is used to find the best possible Algorithm . it is also used to find the BEST,AVERAGE,WORST algo.
                      ==> It include Time & Space Complexity and Asymptotic Notation

b)Asymptotic Notation ==>
